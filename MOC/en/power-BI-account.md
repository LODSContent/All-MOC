## Activate a Fabric trial

1. After signing up for a free Power BI account, in the Power BI portal at +++https://app.fabric.microsoft.com+++, select the **Account Manager** icon (the *user* image at the top right) and in the menu, select **Free trial** to start a Microsoft Fabric trial.
2. After the trial has been started, you can close the browser - just remember the **email** and **password** you used to sign up for Power BI - you'll need them in the exercise.
