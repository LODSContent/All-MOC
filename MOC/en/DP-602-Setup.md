# Before you start

> **Tip**: As you follow the instructions in this pane, whenever you see a +++icon+++, you can use it to copy text from the instruction pane into the virtual machine interface. This is particularly useful to copy code; but bear in mind you may need to modify the pasted code to fix indent levels or formatting before running it!

## Sign into Windows

1. In the virtual machine, sign into Windows using the following credentials:

    - **User name**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-CL-01).Username+++
    - **Password**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-CL-01).Password+++

2. After the trial has been started, you can close the browser - just remember the **email** and **password** you used to sign up for Power BI - you'll need them in the exercise.
