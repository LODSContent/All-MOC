# Before you start

> **Tip**: As you follow the instructions in this pane, whenever you see a +++icon+++, you can use it to copy text from the instruction pane into the virtual machine interface. This is particularly useful to copy code; but bear in mind you may need to modify the pasted code to fix indent levels or formatting before running it!

## Sign into Windows

1. In the virtual machine, sign into Windows using the following credentials:

    - **User name**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-CL-01).Username+++
    - **Password**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-CL-01).Password+++

## Create a free-tier Power BI account

1. In the virtual machine, open a web browser and browse to +++https://app.fabric.microsoft.com+++.

2. When prompted, sign in using the following credentials:

    - **Email**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
    - **Password**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password+++

3. Complete the sign up process to create a new account, entering the phone number +++555 1234567+++ when prompted.

## Activate a Fabric trial

1. After signing up for a free Power BI account, in the Power BI portal at +++https://app.fabric.microsoft.com+++, select the **Account Manager** icon (the *user* image at the top right) and in the menu, select **Start trial** to start a Microsoft Fabric trial.

2. After the trial has been started, you can close the browser - just remember the **email** and **password** you used to sign up for Power BI - you'll need them in the exercise.

Now you're ready to start the exercise on the next page, using the Fabric trial license you just created.
