# Data Engineering with Azure Databricks

Use this hosted environment to complete the practical exercises. There are multiple exercises, each on their own page in this pane. 

The exercises are designed to work independently of one another, and include instructions to create Azure databricks workspaces. However, you can reuse the workspace you create in the first exercise in subsequent exercises. If you end and restart the environment, you will need to recreate your cloud resources.

> **Tip**: As you follow the instructions in this pane, whenever you see a +++icon+++, you can use it to copy text from the instruction pane into the virtual machine interface. This is particularly useful to copy code; but bear in mind you may need to modify the pasted code to fix indent levels or formatting before running it!

Sign into Windows using the following credentials:

- **User name**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(DP-3011-VM).Username+++
- **Password**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(DP-3011-VM).Password+++

During the exercises, use the following credentials to sign into the @lab.CloudSubscription.Name Azure subscription that is provided for you (you can also find this information on the **Resources** tab of this pane):

- **User name**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1-).Username+++
- **Password**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1-).AccessToken+++

Use the **Next >** button at the bottom of this pane to move to the first exercise.
